# Temporary Backend Testing
# Since the Python backend is having dependency issues, let me create a simple mock server for testing

Let me first check the current Python environment and try to fix the backend, but we can at least test the frontend UI now.

The frontend should be accessible at: http://localhost:8080/

## Issues to fix:
1. Python virtual environment setup
2. Backend dependencies installation  
3. Database setup
4. WebSocket connection testing

## What's working:
1. Frontend React app ✓
2. UI components ✓
3. Session management UI ✓
4. API client setup ✓
5. WebSocket client setup ✓
